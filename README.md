# 🌐 Streamlit Langchain Demo Apps

Welcome to the Streamlit Langchain Demo Apps repository! Here, I showcase the capabilities of Langchain, a powerful language processing tool, through a user-friendly web application created using Streamlit. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the application's functionalities.

## 📚 Features

### 1. Single Chain
📍 Input a place's name and get recommendations for the top 5 places to visit in the area.

### 2. Simple Sequential Chain
🌟 Enter a place's name and receive recommendations for the best 5 places to visit, along with estimated expenses and time required for each.

### 3. Summarize Text with `load_summarise_chain`
📝 Paste text and leverage Langchain's `load_summarize_chain` function to generate concise summaries.

### 4. LLMRequestChain
🔍 Pose any query, and the application performs a Google search to provide you with relevant responses.

### 5. Sequential Chain
🎥 This complex chain uses four underlying chains to process movie reviews in any language. It translates them to English, summarizes them, and delivers responses in the original language.
